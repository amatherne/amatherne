title:  "Problem"

My redesign of Strange Brew's website had a single basic goal:

Clarity.

I wanted to find a way to take all of the great content and culture surrounding the establishment and make it more streamlined and user accessible.
The current site they were using was visually overbearing and had little in the way of heirarchy. The mapping and placement of the navigation was also rather confusing. Links, in some cases, appeared to be placed at random. 

I examined the site nav in detail in order to try to make sense of what I was going to be working with. I felt that my best course of action was to take a step back and list all of the content they want available with no order. Once I'd done that I grouped the content into categories. When the content was all organized(ish) I still noticed some irregularities. 

Some items were very similar to others in my list; often identical. My next step was to condense as much of the material as possible. Some pages were combined. Some links were nested. And some content I decided was probably unnecissary in the first place. I wanted to be careful, though, about what items we did away with. 

What did the users care about?

Why were they using the site?

Were they able to find and use the data provided in a logical and easy to understand manner?

The Clarity I was aiming for would decrease the amount of content clutter on the pages, add more whitespace to relieve the strain of viewing, and make the site nav as intuitive as possible. Accomplishing these goals could allow for better promotions of events, food deals, and the basic culture of the shop.

#Project Name

##Client Background/History
- What they do.
- Why they do it.
- Accomplishments of Client

##Research
- SWOT Analysis
- First Landing Walkthrough
    + Watch someone who's never been to site before navigate it
    + Document each step of their process
        * Is each step necissary?
    
##User Stories
- What do the users actually do on the site.
- Include as many stories from different types of users

##Evaluate Findings
- State Findings of Research
    + Problems Identified
    + Immediate / Long Term Goals
    + Final Solutions
- Plan of Implementation
    + Time Line
    + Importance Level
- Discuss CMS with Client
    + Which one do they want and why?
    + Which do you suggest for them?
- This / Not That with Client
    + Helps figure out how they see themselves and what they want
    + Encourage Client to Sketch with you
    + ex: We're Fun. Not Sad.
    + ex: We're Punk. Not Emo.

##Discovery Stage
- Experimentation / Trial & Error
    + Word Lists
    + Textures
    + Photo/Art/Design Inspiration
    + Color
- Sketching (can be done in Illustrator as well, but always pen / paper first)
    + Morphalogical Matrixes
        * 45 second stream of consciousness excercise
        * Pick random items from word list and see how they could match up
        * Save Each Variation
    + Basic Layout and Design Ideas

##Style Decisions
- Semi-Final Style Tiles / Collages
- Detailed Layout Sketches
- Detail Pattern Examples
    + Margins, Padding, Borders, Spacing, 
    + ex: "this" is always "there"
    + ex: "this" is what a 3 column row looks like at "this" screen size
- Design a version of every element possible
    + even ones you aren't planning to use now
    + Client may decide to use it later and doing it now gives them the guide just in case

##Layout
- Low Resolution Wireframes
- Pixel Perfect Mockups

##Implementation
- Build of actual site structure
- Inclusion of Fallbacks / Mixins / Partials
- Test Every Page on All Screen Sizes and in All Browsers

##Future Plans / Goals
- Discussions of ideas to implement once main goals have been completed

##....8?
