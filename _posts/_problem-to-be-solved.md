My redesign of Strange Brew's website had a single basic goal:

Clarity.

I wanted to find a way to take all of the great content and culture surrounding the establishment and make it more streamlined and user accessible.
The current site they were using was visually overbearing and had little in the way of heirarchy. The mapping and placement of the navigation was also rather confusing. Links, in some cases, appeared to be placed at random. 

I examined the site nav in detail in order to try to make sense of what I was going to be working with. I felt that my best course of action was to take a step back and list all of the content they want available with no order. Once I'd done that I grouped the content into categories. When the content was all organized(ish) I still noticed some irregularities. 

Some items were very similar to others in my list; often identical. My next step was to condense as much of the material as possible. Some pages were combined. Some links were nested. And some content I decided was probably unnecissary in the first place. I wanted to be careful, though, about what items we did away with. 

What did the users care about?

Why were they using the site?

Were they able to find and use the data provided in a logical and easy to understand manner?

The Clarity I was aiming for would decrease the amount of content clutter on the pages, add more whitespace to relieve the strain of viewing, and make the site nav as intuitive as possible. Accomplishing these goals could allow for better promotions of events, food deals, and the basic culture of the shop.
