##SWOT Analysis
<fig class="marginnote"><img src="/img/portfolio/strangebrew/wordlist-sm.jpg"><figcaption>An initial wordlist breaking off of "cafe"</figcaption></fig>
1. Strengths

    + Already established as a locally owned and operated business.
    + Known for supporting other local businesses.
    + Named best Live Sound in Austin, Texas.
    + Serves food and coffee 24 hours a day.
    + Consistently draws bigger acts as guest performers.
    + Located in South Austin, away from the hustle and bustle of downtown.
    + No Talking quiet, study room available for students.

2. Weaknesses

    + Current website is difficult to navigate.
    + So many points of interested are scattered about the main page that no single point is highlighted.
    + Odd resizing points and jumpy content positioning can be confusing and uncomfortable.
    + Lack of direction and visual flow could turn away some customers who want important information displayed prominently on the handheld size. Address and phone number are knowwhere to be found on this view.
    + Background image is distracting from main content.

3. Opportunities

    + Already have a great backup of content available to input.
    + Further Representation of the attitude of the business could draw in more locals. Especially in Austin where people care about these things.
    + Highlight upcoming evens in a more apealing way. Make it more delightful for customers, who may percieve the calendar as blocky and spreadsheet-like. Tie calendar visually style with the rest of the site.
    + Quiet room is unique. People many people would love that. Make it more prominent. I dont remember seeing anything about it on first landing.
    + The food is wonderful. Current shots of food could really help boost sales. Offer sandwich of the week or month. Make them limited time.
    + Ex: Torchy's has great customer success with their taco of the month.

4. Threats

    + In the coffee saturated world of Austin, Texas, having a bland or difficult website could easily draw customers to other shops. Customers expect a certain level of enjoyment from cafes and restaurants. 
    + Many local businesses put a lot of effort into their social media marketing. This included Groupons, Instagram, Facebook, etc. They realize that this is an aspect that their clientele care about, so they participate.
    + Consider ways to further promote the shows and events that happen. There's a large clientele base in Austin that strive to go to events. Being so far south makes it more likely that certain crowds wont venture out that far. Find ways to draw in the audiences your competitors enjoy.

- To understand how your users navigate your website i shadowed some new ones. I asked them to search for various items and areas of what you have up now. I wanted to see where their eyes went ,initially and then why, in order to find the list i provided. I also timed them. Knowing the length of time taken can be very helpful if you want certain items to be more prominently displayed or cut down on learning curve for your users. Users on the intrawebs often have a limited attention span and may lose interest if they have to try to hard to use your page. Here's a breakdown of a few First Landings:

- Panini in Food Menu
    - Subject One. 
        1. insert here.
    - Subject Two
        1. Insert here.
- Photo of Billy Gibbons
    - Subject One.
        1. Insert here.
        2. Insert here.
            * This step could easily be taken out.
        3. Insert here.
    - Subject Two.
        1. Insert here.

##User Stories

- I asked some patrons one Sunday why they liked coming to your cafe. Here's what they said:
    + "I love  coming here for the quiet! I dont know of any other place besides the library that has a study room. It's nice not to be disconnected from the cafe and bar though when I want a break!"
        * Austin Matherne
    + "Where else in town could Billy Gibbons walk onstage and just start jammin. It's got a great small town vibe, but delivers BIG."
        * Some awesome dude
    + "It's just where we've always gone. The back patio doesn't get too crowded so we never feel overwhelmed." 
        * Cute Couple

##Findings

- Website is not clearly defined or structured. A clutter of content and lack of many current updates makes the site look ill-used.
- Unneeded redirection to completely different page for the event calender gives impression of unprofessionalism. A more well defined style added to the website and inclusion of calender in that style could give the visual tie ins that web users are expecting from the pages the frequent. They dont want to have to learn different stylistic choices within the same service.
- Lack of easily viewable phone number and address turns away customers looking for the ease of information that other establishments have made more prominent. Especially on the handheld/mobile size that they often need those two options for.

##Timeline

1. Breaking down of site map and important elements
    - Establish a new heirarchy. Combine some items and remove certain redundant ones.
    - Work through what you want to be more important.
    - Grouped accordingly.

2. Discovery
    - Word Lists to begin exploring ideas and concepts. Started with the word 'cafe' to get as many broad concepts as possible. 
        + textures
        + colors
        + photo / art / design inspiration

3. Sketching
    - Ideas started forming after a few runs of layouts. 
    - Started finding a flow that seemed to fit within my word list ideas. 

4. Begin building style tiles for color, texture, element styles, fonts, and layouts.
    - From the discovery phase I'd already built a good base of samples.
    - Mixing and matching colors and fonts together.
    - Explored how buttons, drop menus, search bars, input fields, links, icons, etc might look.
    - Set font sizes and margins.

5. Get approval of Wireframes then move to Pixel Perfect Mock Up.
    - Did my best to avoid some the more played out things competitors' businesses had done while still keeping it similar enough to appease users.

6. Final Build
    - Building of head, header, and footer to be implementing across entire design.
    - Start from handheld design and build responsively for any screen size. 
    - Provide fall backs for all operating systems and browsers. 

##Future Plans and Goals

+ As this redesign was only for a class assignment, i've only done three of the pages. In the future I will be coming back to finish the rest of it.
