I've been playing music with Marcos Gossi for almost 6 years. He's been a dynamic force in my life the entire way. He consistently brings new ideas and bigger thoughts into both my life and the music we make. Just like anyone else, he frequently uses similar phrases over and over; my favorite line is:

##Try doing 'blank'..... just for funsies.


It can be about a new chorus, a "VK Stop"<sup class="sidenote-number">1</sup><fig class="sidenote"><sup class="sidenote-number">1</sup>The <span>VK Stop</span> is a catchall term we coined to describe a certain music motif we use a lot.</fig>, a drum fill, a vocal line, or anything else he comes up with. His word choice makes it feel just like that: for funsies. It takes the pressure and anxiety away and lets new ideas flow freely. It lets us make suggestions to each other and experiment without hurting feelings. And some of my favorite sections of songs have come from this phrase. 

##Bringing this into Design

We've begun doing peer critiques on our projects in class. We do them to double check our ideas and see if they are feasable outside our own minds. This can be terrifying as a new designer. You're already feeling the sting of uncertainty that comes with learning a new craft; add in the presentation of unfinished work and you've got a recipe for distress.
